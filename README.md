# rock_paper_scisors_without_user_defined_function
Rock, Paper, Scissors Game  This is a simple rock paper scissors game. There are better ways of writing this code but this is just for practice. In this code we use the random module to generate the computer's choice I decided not to use a user defined function because i want you to see how things work without using a user defined function.
